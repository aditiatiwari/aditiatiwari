This granular approach allows for a more accurate representation of GoPro's financial structure and operational efficiency.

   **Project Significance:**
  The significance of this DCF model lies in its ability to provide a robust valuation of GoPro's business. By discounting projected future cash flows to their present value, I've estimated the intrinsic value of the company, which can be compared to its current market price to assess whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. This analysis is crucial for investors, analysts, and GoPro's management team in making informed decisions.
